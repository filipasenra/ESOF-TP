# openCX-AgendApp Development Report

Welcome to AgendApp of [**openCX**](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx)!

## Product Vision
At Agendapp our vision is to help conference attendees better manage the lectures they want to take part in. Agendapp is an agenda/schedule type application that offers the user the opportunity to create their own personal schedule based on their own interests, helping them create the perfect programme for their needs. Unlike the old way of checking a conference programme, our app gives the user the opportunity to focus only on the lectures he wants as well as sending him notifications when the talk is about to start and the ability of checking each lecture info on the go.
